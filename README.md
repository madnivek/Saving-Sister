### Architecture and Technologies

The project is implemented using the following technologies:
- `JavaScript` for game logic
- `HTML5 Canvas` for visual rendering to the page
- Assets are either self-made or obtained from OpenGameArt.com and Kenney.nl

The main entry file will be a `game.js` file which will be loaded into an index.html file via a script tag. Util files will handle different pieces of the game such as `sprite.js` which will handle rendering spritesheets and sprite movements and `input.js` which will handle user input.
